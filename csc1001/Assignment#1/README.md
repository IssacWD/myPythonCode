#Assignment CSC1001 #1
###1. About class AssTools
This class is wrote for **code reuse**. Because nearly every question need to judge whether the input is illegal. For higher accuracy, I use regular expression to match the input
```Python
#!AssTools/getInput.py
import re
```
The **getInput** class has the method which can help us to get currect input.
To use those methods, you need to **import** this in front of your code.
```Python
from AssTools.getInput import *method
```
If the input is illegal, it will print:
```bash
Unvalidated Input! Wrong argument in the method!
```
Otherwise, function provides a argument 'length'. It acquiescently equal to 0 (no limit on number's length). If the number is out of range, it will raise:
```bash
Unvalidated Input! Please check the length of your input!
```

###2. Question 1

The **test result**:
```bash
[In]:
Enter the final account value:1000
Enter the annual interest rate:4.25
Enter the number of years:5
```
For some practical reasons, I used format() function to output formatted printing. The result is correct to two decimal places.
```bash
[Out]:
The initial value is 812.12 yuan
```

###3. Question 2
The **test result**:
```bash
[In]:
Enter an integer:3125
[Out]:
3
1
2
5
```
The core code:
```Python
#!q2.py
digits = ceil(log10(number))
output_list = list()
rest = number
for i in range(digits - 1, -1, -1):
    output_list.append(rest // (10 ** i))
    rest = rest % (10 ** i)
```
For using method ceil() and log10(), you need to import them before use them:
```Python
#!q2.py
from math import ceil, log10
```
###4. Question 3
The **test result:**
```bash
[In]:
Enter an integer:10
[Out]:
4
```
If the input is illegal:

###5. Question 4
The **test result:**
```bash
[In]:
Please input a integer:5
[Out]:
m      m+1    m**(m+1)
1      2      1
2      3      8
3      4      81
4      5      1024
5      6      15625
```
I formated the output for look good.
###6. Question 5
```bash
[In]:
Enter an integer:100
[Out]:
The prime numbers smaller than 100 include:
2       3       5       7       11      13      17      19
23      29      31      37      41      43      47      53
59      61      67      71      73      79      83      89
97
```
The core code to judge whether a number is prime:
```python
def Judge(number):
    for i in range(2, number):
        if number % i == 0:
            return False
    return True
```
It is a simple algorithm for prime number judging. There many ways to optimize it's performance. But if the input number is not too big, the different will be small.

If the input is illegal, for example, if the number is smaller than 3, it will raise:
```bash
Do not have any number that meet the requirements!
```
###7. Question 6
The **test result:**
```bash
[In]:
Input the function:sin
Input a:1
Input b:10
Input the number of sub-intervals:10000
[Out]:
The result is 1.3793738814984595
```
If the function is not one of 'sin', 'cos' and 'tan', it will raise:
```bash
Does not support this function!
Please input one of 'sin' 'cos' 'tan'
```
And let you input again.

If you input a b which is smaller than a, it will raise:
```bash
a should be smaller than b
Please input a again:
```
And let you input again.
